    "## Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step to enhance the model's performance by fine-tuning the parameters that govern the learning process. For this, we use the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Randomized Search with Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "   - We perform a randomized search over a predefined grid of hyperparameters for each model. This method samples a fixed number of parameter settings from the specified distributions, allowing a more efficient search than a complete grid search.\n",
    "   - Cross-validation (typically 3-fold) is used to evaluate each combination of parameters. This helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameters Tuning**:\n",
    "   - For **Ridge and Lasso Regression**, we tune the regularization parameter `alpha` to balance the trade-off between fitting the training data and maintaining a model with small weights.\n",
    "   - For **Random Forest**, parameters like the number of trees (`n_estimators`), maximum depth of the trees (`max_depth`), and the maximum number of features considered for splitting (`max_features`) are optimized.\n",
    "   - For **Gradient Boosting**, the number of boosting stages (`n_estimators`), the learning rate, and the maximum depth of the individual trees are tuned.\n",
    "   - For **SVR**, we optimize the regularization parameter `C`, kernel type, and kernel coefficient `gamma`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results**:\n",
    "   - The best set of hyperparameters is selected based on the cross-validation score, and the final model is trained on the entire training dataset.\n",
    "   - The optimized model is then evaluated on the test set to determine its generalization performance.\n",
    "   - This process helps in obtaining the best-performing model that balances the complexity and predictive power.\n",
